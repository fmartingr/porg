# POrg

POrg (or Picture Organizer) is a general multimedia organizer tool, the purpose is to read every file (images and video) from a folder
and move them to another folder sorted into year and month subfolders for easy navigation in a normal filesystem.

Keep in mind that I made this to easily import all my multimedia files from Apple Photos into my NAS, since the application provided
by the NAS company does not import pictures and video metadata correctly (and I'm not sure who to blame for that, but is 99% Apple's fault).
